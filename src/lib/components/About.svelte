<h1>NJ Transit Fatalities</h1>
<div class="intro-body">
	<p>
		It is a moment that takes up but a few short paragraphs or minutes of news coverage, seemingly
		as brief as the duration of the occurrence. When a person is fatally hit by an oncoming train,
		their life, and the lives of their family and friends, and of the train personnel, shatter in
		different ways.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2023, at least 20 people died after being hit by a NJ Transit train, as reported by state and
		local media. However one suddenly dies, whether by suicide or accidentally, these events come
		with little predictability, making them all the more tragic. This visualization shows each of
		the incidents while also attempting to capture the unforeseeability of when someone's life is
		taken.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the visualization starts, the date will increment day by day before stopping on the day of
		a death. The map will display the train station closest to the incident, along with the
		station's train line. Select the <span
			style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: 600; color: var(--orange);">play</span
		>
		button below to start the visualization. You can also
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: 600; color: var(--silver);">pause</span>
		and
		<span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: 600; color: var(--silver);">restart</span> the
		date incrementation.
